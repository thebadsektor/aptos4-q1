# Aptos NFT Marketplace Contract

This contract implements a simple NFT marketplace on the Aptos blockchain. It supports listing, purchasing, transferring, and querying NFTs, with additional features for managing rarity and applying marketplace fees.

## Setup

### Step 1: Update Wallet Address

Replace the placeholder address with your actual wallet address in the following files:

- **`NFTMarketplace.move`**
- **`Move.toml`**

### Step 2: Initialize Project

Navigate to the `contracts` directory and initialize the Aptos project.

```bash
cd contracts
aptos init
```

### Step 3: Compile the Contract
```bash
aptos move compile
```

### Step 4: Publish the Contract
```bash
aptos move publish
```

Once deployed, you can access the contract module on the Aptos Explorer.

### Step 5: Initialize the Marketplace
After deploying, perform the initialization of the marketplace by calling `initialize()`.
